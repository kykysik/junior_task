# Task

Create a PoC solution for a transport logistic company. The user should be able to CRUD Locations, Routes and view Route Plans, automatically generated by the solution.

For simplicity each Location has `(x, y)` pair of coordinates, the Earth is flat, and we live in a Wonderland where each city is connected with all the others.

We expect a high load. So the performance of the Route Plan generation should not influence the performance of other calls to the API.

Solution should expose an API, which is described below.

# API

All request and response bodies should be a valid JSON.

## Locations

Warehouse locations, usually named after localities where they are positioned.

### Model

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|name|string|Name of the location|
|x|number|X coordinate|
|y|number|Y coordinate|
|head|boolean|If given Location can be a beginning of the Route|

### `POST /locations/`
<details>

```
POST /locations/

{ "name": "Morlaw", "x": 10.0500, "y": 33.1210 }
```

Response:

## Route 

Route is a list of Locations that a truck must visit. Relation between Route and Location is hasMany.

For each Route there is a Route Plan that is *generated in the background*, whenever Route or related Location changes.

Route head Location must have a `head` field set to `true`.

### Model

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|name|string|Name of the route|
|head|Location|Location where the route begins|
|locations|Location[]|Locations to visit|

### `POST /routes/`

POST /routes/

{ "name": "Interstate 60", "head": 1, "locations": [27, 33, 314, 466, 666, 1138] }

# Implementation notes

- Use modern Web frameworks - Spring Boot. In case of build tool, it's OK to go with Maven.
- Keep in mind, that the size and the cost of everything matters.
- It's good to think about overloading, limits and possible attacks on the API.
